Step 5 - Troubleshooting
========================


- If the LEDs have been damaged and you can't work out which one is longest the side with the flat edge should be facing towards the right side of the board, where the switch is. An example of an LED flat edge is circled in the image below.
- Do not force the LEDs into the holes, if they will not go in you either have them oriented wrong or there is solder left over from kit manufacturing stuck in the holes which will need to be removed.
