Step 3 - Offshoot
=================

Welcome to the unsoldered kit specific section.

There should be six strips of resistors. Three will be longer than the others - put them to one side, they are spares and you shouldn't need them unless you make a mistake.

You should now have three strips of between one and two resistors. There is very small lettering on all of them showing the value. You may need a microscope or other optical enlargement device to read them.

Conversion Table:

Marking - Location - Value
470 - R2, R3 - 47 ohm
121 - R1 - 120 ohm
0 - R4, R5 - 0 ohm link

(Note - you may have a different preffered way of soldering resistors than the one described below, TL;DR just solder the resistor values shown above to the locations also above.)

If you can, switch to a fine pitch conical tip now, it will make the soldering ahead much easier.

Flow solder onto just one of the pads for all the part locations detailed above (each location is labelled with both the value of resistor to be placed there and it's identifier in white lettering on the board.)

Follow these steps for all three strips. First, remove the plastic cover from the top of the strip, use tweezers if you cannot do it by hand. Being careful not to accidentally inhale the resistors, pick one up with tweezers and place it on the board location shown in the table above. Hold it in place and reflow the side you have already soldered. After making sure the part is securely in place, continue to solder the other side in place. If necessary, touch up the side you soldered originally and ensure both pads have a nice smooth, shiny joint.

If you make a mistake soldering a resistor (and you most likely will) or simply lose one, I've included three spare strips. If necessary, you can desolder a resistor by applying upwards pressure with tweezers while simultaneously heating both sides.
