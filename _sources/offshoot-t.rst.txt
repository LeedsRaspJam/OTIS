Step 3 (Offshoot) - Troubleshooting
===================================


- If you have any, apply flux to all pads before soldering. This will clean off oxides that have formed since the boards were manufactured.
- Avoid lead-free solder, both in general for hand soldering and especially so for SMD soldering. Use a high quality 60/40 solder with a rosin flux core for best results.
- If you have issues later on, the resistors are most likely the culprit, if a specific colour on an LED doesn't work or some LEDs don't work altogether reflow all the joints on your resistors and make sure they are flush with the board.
