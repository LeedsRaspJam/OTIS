Step 2 - Soldering the LEDs
===========================

Position the LEDs so their middle-length pin (on the same side as the notch cut into the LED) is facing towards the side opposite the switch.

Solder the LED pins in place, making sure the LEDs are flush with the board and there are no solder bridges between the pins, and then trim the leads using side cutters (scissors will do if you don't have any).

Troubleshooting
***************

- The spacing between the pins on the LEDs is very small, be careful not to short two pads together.
- If you do short two pads use solder wick or a desoldering pump to remove the solder and start over.
- If the solder joints look crusty or have holes in them then you will need to rework them.
