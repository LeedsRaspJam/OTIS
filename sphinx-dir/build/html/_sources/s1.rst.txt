Troubleshooting
***************

- If solder won't flow check your iron tip is free from any black oxidation and it has been tinned with solder.
- If any copper is showing through the iron plating the tip has worn down and needs to be replaced.
- Check your iron temperature is set to 370°C for lead based solder or 390°C for lead-free solder.
- Check the solder you are using has a flux core and is ideally lead based.
