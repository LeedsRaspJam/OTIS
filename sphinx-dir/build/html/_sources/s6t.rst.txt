Step 6 - Troubleshooting
========================



- The spacing between the pins on the LEDs is very small (this will be fixed in a future board revision) be careful not to short two pads together.
- If you do short two pads use solder wick to remove the solder and start over.
- If the solder joints look crusty or have holes in them then you will need to use solder wick and retry.
