Project OTIS - Assembly Guide (OTISjr.):
========================================

If you are a complete beginner and have never soldered before, we recommend reading through a seperate guide just to learn the basics, see the `"Soldering Tutorial"`_ page. If you have done soldering of any kind before the main assembly guide alone will be sufficent.
