Step 12 - Troubleshooting
=========================


- Make sure all parts have no holes or black spots in the solder joints (if necessary flow more solder in).
- Try applying pressure to the battery holder, if the LEDs light there is a poor connection between the battery and the board, make sure the pins of the battery holder are flush with the board and the two clips on the top of the holder are touching the battery. Adding more solder to the negative pad may also fix this problem.
- If you soldered your own resistors, this is most likely the cause of your problem, go back to the `Step 3 (Offshoot) troubleshooting page`_ and follow the steps there.
- There are some images of what a fully assembled kit should look like below.
